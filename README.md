🎉 Raghav 20.0 – Limited Birthday Edition (Web Project)

📌 Project Description



Raghav 20.0 is a creative, product-style birthday landing page designed as a humorous “e-commerce” showcase for a friend’s 20th birthday. The page presents a fictional premium product profile with animated confetti, ratings, specs, reviews, and a mock “Buy Now” action.
